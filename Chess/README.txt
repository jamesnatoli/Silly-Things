This directory holds all of the programs for the chess program

NewChess works enough to display the board and make moves 
DON'T EDIT NewChess.cpp i need it to make sure i don't break anything permenantly

ShinyChess is a copy of NewChess that I am trying to make work with the header file chessLord.h and the separate file/class board.cpp

New work should be done in ShinyChess such that I can make it better
